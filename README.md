## About the Project
The project is a simple Python program that calculates one's grade in a programming class.

The objective of this program is to demonstrate the following: 
* practice writing a short Python program
* demonstrate knowledge regarding basic selection statements, such as if, elif, and else
* display knowledge of basic Python arithmetic

This program assumes that the user will enter a valid input each time the program requests the number of points earned for each assignment.  The program's output will result in unknown behavior if anything other than an integer or float value is entered by the user.  The program also assumes that the user will enter a positive number for each time the program requests the number of points earned.  If the user enters a negative number, then the grade could end up being lower than zero percent, which is a problem.

## Getting Started
To run the program, download the contents of the project and simply run make in the terminal.
